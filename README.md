# WEB103 Prework - Mary's Creatorverse

Submitted by: Mary Odetayo

About this web app: The app features my top 5 Content creators on youtube. The creators range from react channels, to exploration, to food channels. I watch these creators as a way to de-stress or just have fun. Definetly check out their contents and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. 

Time spent: 20 hours

## Notes

It was very confusing getting supabase connected to the frontend. I had created a table but used the wrong API key so the cards I created for the content creators was not working. I was stuck ont that for a few mins. It was fun to use a new tool for the backend as I had only used AWS for a class project but I like how easy supabase is to set up compared to AWS.
